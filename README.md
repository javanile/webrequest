## Get Started
 
Webrequest is a free service that run PHP code without any kind of web hosting.

       https://www.google.com/search?q=github+creating+new+files >>

    << https://webrequest.cc/{my-github-username}/{my-github-repository} >>

   or connect it to any kind of No-code tools.
 
 
## What can I do?
 
You can use Webrequest.cc as layer of interconnection between systems, as examples:
 
- Transform XML inputs into JSON, then forward the request to another API
- Remove or reduce large inputs into smaller one
- Fork a single No-code trigger to start multiple workflows
 
These are just examples, but you can do EVERYTHING is a PHP script.
